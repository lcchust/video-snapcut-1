# Video-SnapCut
This repository serves as the course project for Advance in Computer Graphics, Zhejiang Unviersity. In this project, we have implemented the video object segmentation system describe in [Video SnapCut: Robust Video Object Cutout Using Localized Classifiers](http://juew.org/publication/VideoSnapCut_lr.pdf).

In this project, we have implemented all the following:
- A complete pipeline of Video-SnapCut (Section 2-3 of the paper)

- Alpha matting (Section 4 of the paper) (We are using this implementation: [AlphaMatting](https://github.com/np-csu/AlphaMatting))

- UI for interactive refinement (Section 5 of the paper)

- Test and comparison against Adobe After Effects' Rotobrush, see our report for more details (Section 6 of the paper)

## Prerequisite
- OpenCV: 3.4.x
- QT: 5.x

## Build
You can build the project using QMake under several platforms. The Qt project file `video-snapcut.pro` is in the`/video-snapcut-ui/video-snapcut` folder. You can also use Qt Creator to open the project.
